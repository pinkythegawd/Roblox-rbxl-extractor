DOCS_FULL_STORY_AND_TUTORIAL

A long story of how this project started, the work performed, the errors encountered and fixed, the bugs that occurred, how I (the agent) approached the project, and a comprehensive tutorial on how to use the extractor.

--- BEGIN STORY

Prologue — why this started

You asked for a way to extract Lua scripts, images, and asset references directly from Roblox .rbxl binary files without first converting them to XML. The motivation is simple and practical: many Roblox places are distributed as .rbxl files (binary), and converting to .rbxl.xml or other intermediary formats adds friction and can lose contextual information. You wanted a single tool that reads binary RBXL files and recovers scripts and assets with resilience against different RBX chunk encodings and broken/unknown encodings.

How I got into the project

You called for a direct binary parser and robust heuristics. I started by examining common patterns: embedded PNG/JPEG signatures, ASCII/UTF printable regions, and the presence of ProtectedString-like XML fragments (which are sometimes embedded literally or split by nulls). The approach chosen was pragmatic: implement high-recall heuristics first to get results quickly, then implement a structured RBX binary parser that can decode the RBX token stream when possible. That way, extraction works even before the parser is complete.

High-level plan I followed

1) Implement heuristics to extract obvious things: PNG/JPEG signatures, long printable text runs, asset URLs, and ProtectedString blocks.
2) Provide a CLI so you can run the extractor directly from your venv. Make the outputs easy to inspect (an "extracted" folder next to the input file).
3) Implement a structured RBX binary parser (BinaryReader, token loop) that tries to decode chunks and instance/property tokens into Instance objects when possible.
4) Integrate both approaches: run parser-first (write extracted parser-sourced scripts), then run heuristics as a high-recall fallback.
5) Harden the parser: decompression heuristics, chunk-length guards, robust fallback when encountering unknown tokens or unsupported ValueTypes.
6) Iterate on heuristics and deduplication until extracted scripts are high-quality and redundant small fragments are reduced.
7) Add tests and documentation.

Chronicle of edits, errors, and fixes — the long list

1) Heuristic extractor implemented (first pass)
- Added helpers: `extract_pngs`, `extract_jpegs`, `extract_ascii_strings`, `extract_protected_strings_from_bytes`, `extract_lua_blocks_by_keywords`, and `extract_merged_printable_blocks`.
- CLI entrypoint `src/rbxl_extractor/cli.py` created to run the extractor easily.

Early result: the heuristics produced lots of candidate strings and recovered many assets and script fragments. But many small fragments and duplicates were present.

2) Packaging/runtime issues (quick fixes)
- Problem: `setup.py` declared `tkinter` as a dependency (not valid for pip). Fix: removed `tkinter` from install_requires so editable install works.
- Problem: initial CLI runs failed due to import and export mismatches (missing `cli.py`, missing `extract_from_binary`). Fix: create `cli.py` and export functions correctly.

3) Parser prototype (`rbx_binary_parser.py`) and early decompression failures
- Implemented `BinaryReader` with helpers: read_byte, read_varint, read_string, read_f32/f64, read_i32/u32, read_interleaved, read_cframe.
- Implemented `RBXBinaryParser` with a token-processing loop for tokens: INST, PROP, PRNT, END.

Error encountered: many RBXL files produced zlib decompression errors like "Error -3 while decompressing data: incorrect header check" or "invalid stored block lengths". That indicated the chunk data wasn't always a plain zlib stream; it might be a raw deflate stream or wrapped in other headers (e.g., gzip), or the chunk_len header was wrong.

Fixes:
- Add multi-strategy decompression attempts: try gzip decompress when appropriate, then zlib (default), then raw deflate (zlib.decompress(..., -15)), then try skipping a small 2-byte header and deflate. This recovered many chunk types.
- Add a safety guard when reading a chunk: if the declared chunk_len is larger than the remaining bytes in the file, abort reading that chunk and log a debug message. This prevented misreads caused by corrupted or misinterpreted size fields.
- Provide a debug mode via environment variable `RBX_PARSER_DEBUG=1` to print chunk headers and decompression failures for diagnosis.

4) Parser value-type coverage and read robustness
- Implemented many of the ValueType handlers for string, bool, int32, float, double, Vector2/3, Color3, Instance references, SharedString, ProtectedString, and added more (Color3Uint8, BrickColor, UDim/UDim2, Vector2Int16, CFrame, NumberRange, Rect, PhysicalProperties, Int64) to increase the chance of decoding property values.

Error encountered: Even after adding many ValueTypes, parser.parse returned 0 Instances for your specific RBXL sample. Diagnostics showed some chunks are uncompressed ASCII-like payloads and one chunk declared an implausible chunk_len (a huge number greater than the remaining bytes), which used to cause mis-parsing and crashes.

Fixes:
- Return raw chunk bytes if all decompress attempts fail; create a chunk-reader for that raw bytes so heuristics can still process the bytes.
- Add logic to try to read the class-name table if present; fallback to inline class names if not.
- When encountering unknown ValueTypes, implement a best-effort skip heuristics: read a varint length or a per-element 32-bit length, read/skip that many bytes and try to decode as text; otherwise append placeholder values. This prevents the parser from getting stuck.

5) Heuristics improvements and deduplication
- Extracted ProtectedString blocks directly from raw bytes (useful because some ProtectedString content is embedded literally or with nulls interrupting). This increased recall.
- Implemented a function-based expansion heuristic: find 'function', expand a large window around it, and try to balance 'function' vs 'end' to find complete functions.
- Implemented merged printable block extraction: treat ASCII/printable runs separated by small gaps as one logical block.
- Deduped candidate scripts by normalizing cleaned text and hashing (sha256), and prefer the longest cleaned variant per canonical script. This significantly reduced duplicate/triplicate script outputs.
- Added a stronger minimum-length filter (>= 120 characters) unless strong indicators (function, local, require) are present to reduce tiny fragments.

Breakages encountered during changes

- Several iterative TypeError/AttributeError and ImportError issues appeared when moving and renaming functions; fixed by ensuring exports and function signatures were correct and `extract_from_binary` returned consistent result dictionaries.
- PowerShell quoting and venv invocation issues when running `python -m rbxl_extractor.cli ...` were handled by explicitly calling the venv python executable and quoting paths properly.
- Some tests invoked Python REPL accidentally (when using incorrect redirection syntax in PowerShell). Fixed by running Python scripts directly from the command line rather than trying to pass inline heredoc that PowerShell didn't accept.

6) Integration and CLI
- `extract_from_binary(input_file, out_dir, options)` implemented to call parser first and heuristics second, write parser-extracted scripts first, then heuristics, and dedupe across both outputs.
- CLI `python -m rbxl_extractor.cli <file> --scripts` added and tested.

7) Tests and docs
- Add `tools/test_extractor.py` to run the extractor in a smoke test mode; it asserts scripts were produced and that at least the largest script contains the `function` keyword.
- Added `DOCS_STORY_AND_TUTORIAL.txt` and `FINAL_SUMMARY.txt` and now `DOCS_FULL_STORY_AND_TUTORIAL.txt` (this document) with narrative and tutorial.

Where the bugs remained and what I chose to do next

- The structured parser still fails to decode Instances for some RBXL variants (such as your sample) even after adding many ValueTypes. Reasons:
  - The chunk layout or token stream may differ from the parser's expectations (RBX token versions, headers, or chunk encodings differ).
  - Some chunk headers are corrupted or use a custom wrapper that requires deeper reverse-engineering.

I prioritized making extraction productive (heuristics-first fallback), and making the parser robust (it doesn't crash now). If you need fully structured decoding (to recover exact ProtectedString values mapped to Instance/class/property), I can continue reverse-engineering and implement the remaining token formats and value encodings.

--- END STORY


--- BEGIN LONG TUTORIAL: How to use this project (detailed)

This tutorial assumes you're on Windows (PowerShell) and you have the repository workspace at:

C:\Users\anonymous\Documents\Visual Code Studio Projects\Github Projects\Roblox rbxl extractor

If your workspace is in a different location, adapt the paths.

1) Prepare the Python environment (venv)

From the project root, create and activate a venv (if not already created):

PowerShell commands:

```powershell
# create venv
python -m venv .venv

# activate venv in PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# optional: upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# install package in editable mode (allows you to edit source files)
pip install -e .
```

Notes:
- `pip install -e .` installs this package in editable mode so changes to `src/rbxl_extractor` are immediately available to your venv Python.
- If you see an error about `tkinter` or other dependencies, make sure `setup.py` doesn't declare platform-only dependencies; this project removed `tkinter` already.

2) Run the CLI extractor

The CLI is a simple wrapper around `extract_from_binary`. To extract scripts and images from an RBXL file, run:

```powershell
python -m rbxl_extractor.cli "C:\path\to\Place_XXXXX.rbxl" --scripts --images --models
```

Options available (as implemented):
- `--scripts` : extract Lua scripts (heuristics + parser output)
- `--images` : extract embedded PNG/JPEG images
- `--models` : write model-like printable blocks (XML-like snippets)
- `--sounds` : extract sound-like strings if present

What the CLI does:
- Opens the RBXL file and reads all bytes.
- Tries the structured parser first (if available) to decode Instances and gather any property values that look like script content (for example, `Source` properties or `ProtectedString` values). Writes these parser-sourced scripts first.
- Runs heuristics to extract additional scripts and assets from raw bytes (PNG/JPEG extraction, ProtectedString search, printable block merging, function-based expansion).
- Deduplicates scripts by normalized content (whitespace-normalized SHA256) and prefers the longest cleaned variant per canonical script.
- Writes output into a sibling `extracted` folder in the same directory as the input RBXL. Example: `C:\path\to\extracted\Scripts` and `C:\path\to\extracted\Images`.

3) Inspect the output

After the CLI runs successfully, check the extracted folder next to your RBXL file. Example:

```
C:\Users\anonymous\Downloads\Phone Link\extracted\
  Scripts\
    script_0.lua
    script_1.lua
    ...
  Images\
    embedded_44194.jpg
    ...
  References\
    assetref_0.txt
    ...
```

Open the `.lua` files in a text editor. Most large recovered scripts will contain real Lua source code with `function`, `local`, `end`, and API calls referencing `game`, `workspace`, etc. Smaller script fragments may be noise or property fragments; you can filter them by size.

4) Use the test harness

A small smoke test `tools/test_extractor.py` exists to automate a sanity-check run against your sample RBXL file. Run it like:

```powershell
python tools/test_extractor.py
```

What it does:
- Runs `extract_from_binary` on the configured RBXL file path (edit the script if you want to run a different file).
- Prints the number of scripts found and the largest script path/size.
- Asserts that at least one large script contains the keyword `function` (smoke check pass). If the script fails, it exits with a non-zero status for CI.

This tutorial assumes you're on Windows (PowerShell) and you have the repository workspace at:

C:\Users\MikePinku\Documents\Visual Code Studio Projects\Github Projects\Roblox rbxl extractor

If your workspace is in a different location, adapt the paths.

1) Prepare the Python environment (venv)

From the project root, create and activate a venv (if not already created):

PowerShell commands:

```powershell
# create venv
python -m venv .venv

# activate venv in PowerShell
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

# optional: upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# install package in editable mode (allows you to edit source files)
pip install -e .
```

Notes:
- `pip install -e .` installs this package in editable mode so changes to `src/rbxl_extractor` are immediately available to your venv Python.
- If you see an error about `tkinter` or other dependencies, make sure `setup.py` doesn't declare platform-only dependencies; this project removed `tkinter` already.

2) Run the CLI extractor

The CLI is a simple wrapper around `extract_from_binary`. To extract scripts and images from an RBXL file, run:

```powershell
python -m rbxl_extractor.cli "C:\path\to\Place_XXXXX.rbxl" --scripts --images --models
```

Options available (as implemented):
- `--scripts` : extract Lua scripts (heuristics + parser output)
- `--images` : extract embedded PNG/JPEG images
- `--models` : write model-like printable blocks (XML-like snippets)
- `--sounds` : extract sound-like strings if present

What the CLI does:
- Opens the RBXL file and reads all bytes.
- Tries the structured parser first (if available) to decode Instances and gather any property values that look like script content (for example, `Source` properties or `ProtectedString` values). Writes these parser-sourced scripts first.
- Runs heuristics to extract additional scripts and assets from raw bytes (PNG/JPEG extraction, ProtectedString search, printable block merging, function-based expansion).
- Deduplicates scripts by normalized content (whitespace-normalized SHA256) and prefers the longest cleaned variant per canonical script.
- Writes output into a sibling `extracted` folder in the same directory as the input RBXL. Example: `C:\path\to\extracted\Scripts` and `C:\path\to\extracted\Images`.

3) Inspect the output

After the CLI runs successfully, check the extracted folder next to your RBXL file. Example:

```
C:\Users\MikePinku\Downloads\Phone Link\extracted\
  Scripts\
    script_0.lua
    script_1.lua
    ...
  Images\
    embedded_44194.jpg
    ...
  References\
    assetref_0.txt
    ...
```

Open the `.lua` files in a text editor. Most large recovered scripts will contain real Lua source code with `function`, `local`, `end`, and API calls referencing `game`, `workspace`, etc. Smaller script fragments may be noise or property fragments; you can filter them by size.

4) Use the test harness

A small smoke test `tools/test_extractor.py` exists to automate a sanity-check run against your sample RBXL file. Run it like:

```powershell
python tools/test_extractor.py
```

What it does:
- Runs `extract_from_binary` on the configured RBXL file path (edit the script if you want to run a different file).
- Prints the number of scripts found and the largest script path/size.
- Asserts that at least one large script contains the keyword `function` (smoke check pass). If the script fails, it exits with a non-zero status for CI.

5) Enable parser debug diagnostics (if you want to help debugging parser failures)

If `RBX_PARSER_DEBUG` is set in the environment, `rbx_binary_parser.py` prints per-chunk diagnostic lines about `chunk_len`, the reserved field, and the first bytes of the chunk as hex. This is useful when trying to figure out why the structured parser fails to decode Instances.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:RBX_PARSER_DEBUG=1
python -m rbxl_extractor.cli "C:\path\to\Place_XXXXX.rbxl" --scripts
```

Interpreting the debug output:
- `[rbxparser] chunk_len=8704 reserved=0 head=00 F0 13 ...` shows a chunk with length 8704 and the first bytes hex.
- Decompression failure messages show which strategies failed (zlib/gzip/raw-deflate). If none succeeded, the parser returns raw bytes for the chunk and heuristics will process it.
- If you see `chunk_len (1007...) > remaining (320958) - aborting chunk read`, it means the chunk header claims an implausible length; the parser now aborts reading the chunk rather than mis-reading the file and crashing.

6) How the heuristics work (in detail)

- extract_pngs: scans for the PNG signature (0x89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A) and tries to read chunks until `IEND`. Writes found PNGs into `Images`.
- extract_jpegs: scans for JPEG SOI/EOI markers (0xFF D8 ... 0xFF D9) and writes found JPEGs into `Images`.
- extract_ascii_strings: uses a regex to find sequences of printable characters (length >= 8 by default); decoded as UTF-8 or fallback to Latin-1.
- extract_protected_strings_from_bytes: finds the raw byte sequence `<ProtectedString name="Source">` and extracts until `</ProtectedString>`, stripping nulls and decoding. This recovers many script sources that are embedded as XML-like fragments.
- extract_lua_blocks_by_keywords: finds `function` occurrences in raw bytes, expands a larger window around each occurrence, decodes the window and then tries to balance `function` vs `end` occurrences to capture plausible function bodies.
- extract_merged_printable_blocks: merges printable runs separated by small gaps (default gap 48 bytes), decodes, and returns longer blocks which often contain script bodies or model XML.
- find_asset_urls: filters ascii strings for `rbxasset`, `http`, `.com`, etc., and writes references to `References`.

7) How the structured parser works (and why it sometimes fails)

- The parser first validates the magic header `<roblox!` and reads a few header fields (version, number of classes, compressed flag).
- It reads chunks: each chunk is preceded by a chunk length (u32) and reserved (u32). It then reads `chunk_len` bytes and attempts to decompress the chunk using multi-strategy approach.
- The chunk (after decompression) is treated as a token stream. The parser reads a byte token (INST/PROP/PRNT/END) and dispatches to handlers that read class ids, names, property names, value types, and property values — using the BinaryReader helpers (varints, strings, floats, etc.).

Why the parser sometimes returns 0 instances:
- Some RBXL files may have chunk encodings, token versions, or header layouts the parser does not expect yet. For example, the class-name table may be encoded differently, or the chunk might be a raw uncompressed token stream that the parser doesn't detect correctly.
- Some chunk headers claim an implausible `chunk_len` (due to variation, or file corruption), and earlier code tried to read past the file; now we detect that and abort safely.

Notes on achieving structured parse success for a particular file

If accurate structured parsing (mapping Instances and property values precisely) is required for a specific RBXL, the following are recommended diagnostic steps that I can perform:
- Re-run the parser with `RBX_PARSER_DEBUG=1` to capture per-chunk diagnostic logs (chunk lengths and a hex preview of the chunk head).
- Inspect the chunk head hex to determine whether the chunk appears to be compressed (and if so, which wrapper), or whether it is an uncompressed token stream. If it uses a header/wrapper I don't yet handle, I can add detection and decompress accordingly.
- If a chunk appears to be a raw token stream (not compressed), I can try parsing it directly without decompression and adapt token-handling as needed.
- If the token/token-version format differs from current assumptions, I can implement per-version token handling and update the parser accordingly.

8) How to extend the parser with new ValueTypes

If you want to add additional RBX ValueTypes, follow these steps:

- Open `src/rbx_extractor/rbx_binary_parser.py`.
- Find the `_read_property` method and the `if/elif` chain for value_type. Add a new branch for the ValueType you're implementing. Use the BinaryReader helpers (read_f32, read_i32, read_string, etc.).
- After implementing, run the parser on the local RBXL file with `RBX_PARSER_DEBUG=1` and inspect whether the parser progresses further and assigns properties to instances.

9) How to tune heuristics if you see too many small fragments

- Edit `src/rbxl_extractor/binary_extractor.py` and adjust the parameters passed to `extract_merged_printable_blocks` (min_len, max_gap) and the minimum length threshold used when accepting cleaned scripts.
- The current setup uses min_len=120 for merged blocks and a final filter that rejects cleaned scripts under 120 chars unless they contain strong Lua indicators.
- You can also tune `LUA_KEYWORDS` or the score threshold in `find_lua_candidates` to be more strict.

10) Packaging / distribution

If you want to bundle the tool for distribution:
- This project is a pure Python package; you can build a wheel and upload it or create a small standalone EXE using tools like PyInstaller.
- For a quick local zip, run the CLI and zip the `extracted` folder for sharing.

Example: Create ZIP of extracted output using PowerShell

```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path "C:/path/to/extracted/*" -DestinationPath "C:/path/to/extracted.zip" -Force
```

11) Running a full session (example)

```powershell
# activate venv
.\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1

# run extractor for scripts and images
python -m rbxl_extractor.cli "C:\Users\anonymous\Downloads\Phone Link\Place_137283905857565.rbxl" --scripts --images

# optionally inspect debug output (if parser issues are suspected)
$env:RBX_PARSER_DEBUG=1
python -m rbxl_extractor.cli "C:\Users\anonymous\Downloads\Phone Link\Place_137283905857565.rbxl" --scripts --images

# run the smoke-test
python tools/test_extractor.py

# package results
Compress-Archive -Path "C:/Users/anonymous/Downloads/Phone Link/extracted/*" -DestinationPath "C:/Users/anonymous/Downloads/Phone Link/extracted.zip" -Force
```

12) How to contribute and next steps (for you or me)

Candidate next steps I can implement for you, depending on priority:

A) Deep parser reverse-engineer (best for long-term):
- Inspect the undecoded chunk bytes and attempt to parse token streams that are not compressed (detect token versions), or add decompression wrappings if a custom header is used.
- Add remaining ValueType handlers (faces, meshes, Ray, Path, Region3, arrays of values, etc.).
- Map instance properties, names, and referents fully so ProtectedString Source values are recovered accurately.
- Implement fallback strategies to combine parser-sourced script text and heuristics into a single canonical script representation with metadata (class, property, referent).

B) Heuristics tuning and analysis (fast wins):
- Add merging by overlap (if two scripts share long identical substrings, merge them).
- Add a small scoring function that ranks candidate scripts by number of Lua keywords, length, and uniqueness, and pick top N per file.

C) Tests and CI (medium effort):
- Convert `tools/test_extractor.py` to `pytest` tests and add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to run smoke tests on pushes.

D) Packaging (low effort):
- Build a wheel and publish to a private PyPI or give you a packaged zip/exe for distribution.

13) Final notes on safety and reproducibility

- This tool reads arbitrary binary files but does not execute any code it extracts. The Lua source recovered is plain text written to disk; you should inspect code before running it in any untrusted environment.
- Debug logs can print internal data (chunk hex); keep that in mind if sharing logs widely.

Appendix: A ten-year retrospective (narrative)

This appendix is written in the spirit of a decade-long retrospective. It adopts a reflective voice: looking back over many years, noting shifts in objectives, decisions that seemed minor at the time but had outsized consequences, and the patterns that shaped the project.

Origins and first experiments

The early work began with a pragmatic itch: developers needed to recover Lua source and assets directly from Roblox's binary `.rbxl` files without relying on XML intermediates. The initial prototypes were intentionally small and tactical — short Python scripts that scanned for PNG/JPEG signatures, used a regex to pull long printable runs, and wrote out candidate text. Those quick wins validated the idea. On the first real test file, a significant Lua script was recovered that would otherwise have required extra tooling to surface.

The research-and-build phase

After that first success, the project moved through a research phase where I (the developer team) gathered information about RBX binary quirks. The BinaryReader abstraction was introduced to centralize lower-level operations (varints, length-prefixed strings, floats). Early attempts at a structured parser exposed fragility: chunk decompression failed in multiple ways, and property encodings varied across files. That period was full of small experiments — try a new decompression approach, add a logging line, or extract a problematic chunk for offline analysis — and the project advanced by iterating on these hypotheses.

Establishing pragmatic priorities

Two strategic decisions came early and stayed: first, make heuristics useful immediately; second, make the parser robust and never allow it to be the single point of failure. Those principles guided the implementation: heuristics (ProtectedString extraction, function-based expansion, merged printable blocks) were developed to give immediate value, while the parser evolved slowly and deliberately with multiple fallback strategies.

Hardening for real-world files

Real place files are messy. Over the years the extractor encountered many oddities: chunk lengths that look wrong, various compression wrappers, and evolving value encodings. Each anomaly prompted a specific response: add more decompression heuristics (gzip, zlib, raw-deflate), guard against truncated chunk lengths, and implement safe skipping for unknown value types. These incremental improvements transformed a brittle prototype into a tool that is forgiving with real data.

The role of heuristics

Heuristics carried much of the project's user-facing value. They were high-recall and resilient: combined, they recovered large scripts, images, and asset references even when the structured parser could not decode instances. The pragmatic approach was to use the parser where it worked and to fall back to heuristics otherwise. Over time, deduplication and normalization (whitespace-normalized SHA256 keys) reduced redundant outputs and made results easier for users to inspect.

People, collaboration, and small rituals

Over a decade the project had many small contributors: colleagues who reported file-specific failures, collaborators who added new heuristics, and reviewers who asked for clearer error logging. A few small rituals helped maintain velocity: whenever a new failure was reported, the offending chunk was saved and a small diagnostic was written to a tools directory; changes were kept small and accompanied by a single smoke test; and maintainers preferred changes that improved the most common case for end-users.

Trade-offs and sustained maintenance

Long-term maintenance revealed consistent trade-offs. A perfectly complete parser would have been a large engineering investment, but heuristics offered immediate utility. The chosen compromise — prioritize robustness and incremental parser improvements — meant the tool remained useful and deployable while the parser matured slowly. Documenting those trade-offs here makes them visible and simplifies future decisions.

Memorable bugs and fixes

- Zlib header errors: Early decompression failures were often cryptic. Adding gzip detection and raw-deflate fallbacks recovered many chunks.
- Implausible chunk lengths: Sometimes the chunk length field was larger than remaining file bytes. Introducing a guard to abort such reads prevented misparsing and crashes.
- Fragmentation of scripts: Scripts split by nulls and metadata required a merged-printable-block approach and stronger minimum-length checks to avoid producing many tiny fragments.

What lasted and what changed

Several core ideas endured: prefer small utilities (BinaryReader, PNG/JPEG extractors), favor heuristics for recall, and keep the parser resilient. What changed was the detail: more decompression options, additional value-type handlers, better deduplication, and a test harness that validated core expectations.

Looking forward

A decade later the extractor is a pragmatic tool with clear improvement paths: finish more value-type implementations, improve token-version detection, add overlap-based merging for scripts, and expand tests. The design principles that served the project — incrementalism, layered fallback, and reproducible diagnostics — still apply.
